# Quiz-bot-for-my-students
This is a simple and fun Telegram quiz bot I built to help students (especially in Bangladesh 🇧🇩) practice and improve through quick, interactive questions. It uses the OpenTDB API to fetch trivia questions and lets users answer right inside Telegram — with buttons, score tracking, and instant feedback!

✨ What It Can Do
🎯 Sends random multiple-choice questions

💬 Lets you answer with inline buttons (no typing!)

✅ Tells you if you're right or wrong, instantly

🧪 Supports different topics and difficulty levels

📈 Great for daily practice or group learning

🧑‍💻 How It Works
Start the bot by sending /start

It sends you a quiz question with 4 choices

Tap your answer and get instant feedback

It updates your score after each question

Use /score to see how you're doing
